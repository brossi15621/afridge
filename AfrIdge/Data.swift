Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly. Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet.

Remove the chicken to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm. Lower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings in the pan, saute for 1 minute to render out some of the fat. Now, add the mushrooms and saute until they are nicely browned and their moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Pour the Marsala in the pan and boil down for a few seconds to cook out the alcohol. Add the chicken stock and simmer for a minute to reduce the sauce slightly.

As I was looking through my pantry and fridge taking note of what needed to be used up today, I noticed I had half a jar of taco sauce, a small can of diced green chiles, and a whole block of pepper jack cheese. I knew immediately that I wanted a cheesy skillet full of Ultimate Southwest Scrambled Eggs for lunch. It’s like loaded nachos, except all egg and no nacho. LOL. As a devout egg lover, I’m not sad about that. These “loaded” scrambled eggs also make a great base for breakfast tacos, breakfast burritos, or even breakfast quesadillas. Got leftover tortilla chips? Break them up and toss them right in the skillet with the cheesy eggs for a crunchy finish. When avocados are in season and less than a dollar each, dice them up and add them to the party. Salsa can be used in place of the taco sauce (although it can make the mix a bit more watery), or if you have any leftover homemade enchilada sauce, you can use that. If you’re a meat-manditory person, you can brown some breakfast sausage, ground beef, or bacon in the skillet before cooking the eggs (remove the meat first, then stir it back in later), or simply add some shredded rotisserie chicken.
